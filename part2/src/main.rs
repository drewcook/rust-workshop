    u8 is 1 byte, u16 is 2 bytes, etc i64 is 64 bits / 8 bytes

    Only arrays are iterable, and must be defined length and type.
    Define order for structs and tuples determines what order they compile down to be stored in memory.
    All three types eventually just end up as bytes in an order in memory.
